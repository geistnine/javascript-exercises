Create function
    if (arg1 > arg2) create variable biggerNum storing arg1 and smallerNum storing arg2
        else reverse these assignments
    sum = biggerNum
    For loop, let i = biggerNum, as long as i is bigger than or equal to smallerNum,
        decrementing
        sum += i 
    return sum
